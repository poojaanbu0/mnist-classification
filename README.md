# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Digit Classification

## AIM
To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for digit classification and to verify the response for scanned handwritten images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
```
Problem Statement: Handwritten Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

Objective: Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

Data: The MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classification, contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).
